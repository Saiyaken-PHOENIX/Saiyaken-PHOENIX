I have a certain disdain for many giga-corpos. such as, but not limited to... 
Facebook (Meta, all the AI garbage as well)
Apple (Self-explanatory)
Google (Also self-explanatory)
Microsoft (Also self-explanatory, forcing the removal of Mojang accounts for their nanny state)
Amazon (Scams all the way around, made to destroy mom-and-pop shops)
Netflix (Scams with forced compliance of passwords and payments long before due date)

I do NOT want your Gemini Copilot GPT nonsense.

Probably gonna head to Codeberg at some point
